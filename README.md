 # DeClEx - Advanced Processing Pipeline for Critical Healthcare Application

## DeClEx Architecture 
The architecture consists of 1. **dedicated denoising and deblurring autoencoders** to mitigate noise and blur. We then compare our CNN + Spatial Attention model with state of the art architectures and highlight it's advantages. 
We provide explianability for the model's prediction using **Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)** and **Shapley Additive Explanations(SHAP)**
